## Object Oriented Programming Methodology

### Class

```python
A class is a user-defined data type. Its a collection of
objects, where objects can represent just about anything
from integers to real world objects like a ball.
```
_For example:_

```python
class world:
    def hello(self):
        print("Hello World!")

obj=world()
obj.hello()
```
